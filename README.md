# Page-Tribute
Website to fulfill the first task in the front end development certification for FreeCodeCamp

## Task
+ Build a tribute page, similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW)
+ Fulfilling the following user stories
  1. there exist a page with at least some text and an image
  2. there exist a link forwarding the user to additional information

## [Personal solution](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/JOrgrR/)
Page tribute to a fictional character in a semi popular television series, G.O.B. from arrested development

#### Chosen the particular figure in order to 
1. reduce the need for research and detail, leveraging few bits of information from memory instead of scraping the web for information
2. focus on the form more than the substance of the piece
3. include some topical feature in the page (a "magic trick" in the form of a disappearing div)

#### Using the following libraries
1. bootstrap
2. jquery

#### Following the used practices
1. *comment* 
    - <!-- everything --> 
    - /* and everything */ 
    - // and everything

2. *divide* (perhaps not everything)
    - index.html [HTML]
    - style.css [CSS]
    - script.js [JS|jQuery]
  
3. leverage *stock images* from [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
